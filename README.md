# Autumn-Tree-Simulation-CG
The Autumn Tree project presents a small interactive graphical scene using the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. It includes various elements such as birds, falling leaves, clouds, a tree, and a boat. The scene is animated with dynamic movements, such as the flapping wings of the birds and the falling motion of the leaves.
The project demonstrates the use of OpenGL commands to draw 2D shapes, manipulate their positions, and create animations. It showcases the power of computer graphics in creating visually appealing scenes and simulating natural phenomena.
The code can serve as a starting point for further development or experimentation with OpenGL graphics. It provides a foundation for adding more elements, refining the animations, and exploring additional features of OpenGL.
Overall, the project combines programming skills, mathematical calculations, and graphical rendering techniques to create an interactive and visually engaging scene using the OpenGL library
